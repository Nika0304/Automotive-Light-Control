# 🚗 Automotive Light Control and Diagnostics Project

A group project simulating and testing the functionality of various automotive lighting components.  
The system was designed using **Proteus** for circuit simulation and **Arduino** for control logic, enabling realistic behavior testing under different operating conditions.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project aimed to replicate and verify the operation of automotive lighting systems, including:
- Flasher
- Low beam headlights
- Position lights

The focus was on both **functional verification** and **diagnostic analysis**, ensuring that each component behaved correctly and safely in different scenarios.
